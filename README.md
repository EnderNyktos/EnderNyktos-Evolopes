# EnderNyktos-Evolopes
I always found lazy those neutralopes over there, they're just there, you tame then and then you're rich. This mod adds some difficulty to get them: You will need 1 Healer Mech Serum + 10 units of some product, you craft and Evolope Mech Serum to transform your Antelope into Neutrolope, Devilope, Chocolope, etc.
